# Object Oriented Javascript 

See the live preview of this project : https://dinosaurs-ijs.vercel.app/

### Big Picture
For the project, you will generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, you will display the name of the human rather than species and no fact is necessary for the human. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed should be random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts (3 should be from the methods you create). One of the titles should be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”
